**Project Overview**

This platform is designed to simulate an interactive, shared workspace in a 3D virtual environment. It is compatible with various VR/AR devices, offering features that facilitate remote meetings, collaborative work sessions, and training activities.

**Key Use Cases**

Corporate Meetings with spatial audio and avatar presence.
Collaborative Whiteboards for brainstorming.
3D Model Interaction for engineering, design, and healthcare applications.

**Features**

3D Virtual Environment for immersive collaboration.
Avatars with Gesture Recognition for natural communication.
Virtual Tools including whiteboards, file sharing, and sticky notes.
Mixed Reality Integration with real-world AR elements.
Cross-Platform Support for VR headsets and desktops.

**Technology Stack**

Front-End: Unity (for VR/AR 3D development)
Backend: Firebase / WebRTC (for real-time data handling)
Hosting: Netlify (for web hosting)
APIs: Photon, Firebase (for multi-user sync and file sharing)
