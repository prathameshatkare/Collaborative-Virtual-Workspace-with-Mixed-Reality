## Project Overview

This platform is designed to simulate an interactive, shared workspace in a 3D virtual environment. It is compatible with various VR/AR devices, offering features that facilitate remote meetings, collaborative work sessions, and training activities.

### Key Use Cases
- **Corporate Meetings** with spatial audio and avatar presence.
- **Collaborative Whiteboards** for brainstorming.
- **3D Model Interaction** for engineering, design, and healthcare applications.

## Features

- **3D Virtual Environment** for immersive collaboration.
- **Avatars with Gesture Recognition** for natural communication.
- **Virtual Tools** including whiteboards, file sharing, and sticky notes.
- **Mixed Reality Integration** with real-world AR elements.
- **Cross-Platform Support** for VR headsets and desktops.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-End**: Unity (for VR/AR 3D development)
- **Backend**: Firebase / WebRTC (for real-time data handling)
- **Hosting**: Netlify (for web hosting)
- **APIs**: Photon, Firebase (for multi-user sync and file sharing)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- Unity installed if you plan to work on 3D environment development.
- A compatible VR headset (e.g., Meta Quest) for testing the virtual experience.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathameshatkare/Collaborative-Virtual-Workspace-with-Mixed-Reality.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Environment Setup

- Ensure you have configured Firebase (or the real-time database of your choice) for managing session data.
- If youâ€™re working on VR/AR features, follow the Unity setup to integrate VR/AR devices.
